# Branch Naming Guidelines

## Introduction
This document outlines the guidelines for naming branches in our version control system. Following a consistent naming convention helps to keep our repository organized and makes it easier to understand the purpose of each branch.

## Why Do We Need Branch Naming Conventions?
- **Clarity:** Provides a clear understanding of the branch's purpose.
- **Consistency:** Ensures all team members follow the same rules, making it easier to collaborate.
- **Organization:** Helps in keeping the repository clean and structured.

## Branch Types and Naming Conventions

### 1. Feature Branches
**Purpose:** Used for developing new features.

**Naming Convention:** `feature/short-description`

**Example:** `feature/user-authentication`

### 2. Bugfix Branches
**Purpose:** Used for fixing bugs in the code.

**Naming Convention:** `bugfix/short-description`

**Example:** `bugfix/login-error`

### 3. Hotfix Branches
**Purpose:** Used for urgent fixes that need to go into the production branch immediately.

**Naming Convention:** `hotfix/short-description`

**Example:** `hotfix/critical-security-patch`

### 4. Release Branches
**Purpose:** Used for preparing a new release.

**Naming Convention:** `release/version-number`

**Example:** `release/1.0.0`

### 5. Experimental Branches
**Purpose:** Used for experimental features that are not guaranteed to be included in the main codebase.

**Naming Convention:** `experiment/short-description`

**Example:** `experiment/new-layout`

## General Rules
- **Use Lowercase:** Branch names should be in lowercase.
- **Use Hyphens:** Separate words with hyphens (not underscores).
- **Be Descriptive:** Make the branch name as descriptive as possible within a reasonable length.
- **Avoid Special Characters:** Do not use special characters like `@`, `#`, or `&`.

## Examples

| Branch Type        | Naming Convention              | Example                         |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Feature Branch     | `feature/short-description`    | `feature/user-authentication`   |
| Bugfix Branch      | `bugfix/short-description`     | `bugfix/login-error`            |
| Hotfix Branch      | `hotfix/short-description`     | `hotfix/critical-security-patch`|
| Release Branch     | `release/version-number`       | `release/1.0.0`                 |
| Experimental Branch| `experiment/short-description` | `experiment/new-layout`         |

## Conclusion
By following these naming conventions, we can maintain a clean and organized repository, making it easier for everyone to collaborate and understand the purpose of each branch.
